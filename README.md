# Eng4Day - AI Persona Chat Application

Eng4Day is a dynamic, real-time chat application that allows users to interact with an AI that can adopt various "personas." This provides a highly engaging and customizable user experience, moving beyond a generic chatbot to a platform for role-playing, learning, and entertainment.

## Key Features

### 1. Dynamic AI Personas
Instead of a single, static AI, users can chat with a variety of characters. Each persona has a unique personality, goals, and avatar.

### 2. Mid-Conversation Persona Switching
Users can seamlessly switch the AI's persona at any point during a conversation. The UI updates instantly to reflect the change, showing the new persona's avatar in the message input bar.

### 3. Intelligent Avatar System
Each persona is visually represented by an avatar. You can provide a URL to a custom image or let the application generate a stylish, color-coded fallback avatar based on the persona's name.

### 4. Full Chat History & Management
All chat sessions are saved and displayed in a scrollable sidebar, allowing users to easily revisit past conversations or start new ones.

### 5. AI Model Selection
The application allows for the selection of different underlying AI models (e.g., Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini Pro), giving users control over the AI's response generation capabilities.
